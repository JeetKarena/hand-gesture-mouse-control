# hand-gesture-mouse-control
A Python-based virtual mouse system that uses real-time webcam input to detect and classify right-hand gestures using MediaPipe and optionally a custom TensorFlow deep learning model. Mapped gestures trigger native system actions like mouse movement, clicks, scrolling, and window switching.
